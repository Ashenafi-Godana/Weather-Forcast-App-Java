### Introduction
- **WeatherApp**: A Java-based application that fetches and displays current weather and a 5-day forecast for a specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

---

### Overview
- The application uses a graphical user interface (GUI) created with Swing components.
- It follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: inheritance, abstraction, interfaces, and modularity.

---

### Main Components
1. **WeatherApp.java**
    - **Role**: The main class that initializes the GUI and handles user interactions.
    - **Components**:
        - **JFrame**: The main window.
        - **JTextField**: For user input (location).
        - **JLabel**: To display the location, current temperature, description, and forecast.
        - **WeatherService**: An interface for fetching weather data.
        - **WeatherDisplay**: A class to update the GUI with weather data.

2. **WeatherService.java**
    - **Role**: An interface defining the methods to fetch current weather and forecast data.
    - **Methods**:
        - `Map<String, Object> getCurrentWeather(String location) throws Exception`
        - `List<Map<String, Object>> getWeatherForecast(String location) throws Exception`

3. **OpenWeatherMapService.java**
    - **Role**: Implements the `WeatherService` interface to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
    - **Methods**:
        - `Map<String, Object> getCurrentWeather(String location) throws Exception`
        - `List<Map<String, Object>> getWeatherForecast(String location) throws Exception`
    - **Inheritance**: Inherits from `WeatherFetcher` for HTTP request handling.

4. **WeatherFetcher.java**
    - **Role**: An abstract class that contains the common logic for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
    - **Methods**:
        - `String getWeatherData(String location, boolean isCurrent) throws Exception`

5. **WeatherParser.java**
    - **Role**: A utility class for parsing JSON data returned by the OpenWeatherMap API.
    - **Methods**:
        - `static Map<String, Object> parseCurrentWeather(String jsonString)`
        - `static List<Map<String, Object>> parseForecast(String jsonString)`

6. **WeatherDisplay.java**
    - **Role**: A class responsible for updating the GUI components with the fetched weather data.
    - **Methods**:
        - `void displayWeather(JLabel locationLabel, JLabel tempLabel, JLabel descriptionLabel, JLabel[] forecastLabels, Map<String, Object> currentWeather, List<Map<String, Object>> forecast)`

---

### Workflow
1. **Initialization**:
    - `WeatherApp` initializes the GUI components and sets up the layout.
    - A `WeatherService` instance (`OpenWeatherMapService`) is created for fetching weather data.

2. **User Interaction**:
    - User enters a location in the `JTextField` and clicks the "Get Weather" button.
    - `fetchWeather` method is triggered by the button click event.

3. **Data Fetching**:
    - `fetchWeather` method:
        - Creates a new thread to avoid blocking the GUI.
        - Calls `getCurrentWeather` and `getWeatherForecast` on the `WeatherService` instance.
        - Parses the JSON response using `WeatherParser`.

4. **Data Display**:
    - Weather data is passed to the `WeatherDisplay` class.
    - `WeatherDisplay` updates the `JLabel` components in the GUI to show the current weather and forecast.

### Key OOP Concepts
1. **Abstraction**:
    - `WeatherService` interface defines the contract for weather data fetching.
    - `WeatherParser` abstracts the JSON parsing logic.

2. **Inheritance**:
    - `OpenWeatherMapService` inherits from `WeatherFetcher` to reuse HTTP request logic.

3. **Encapsulation**:
    - Each class has a specific responsibility, and internal workings are hidden from other classes.

4. **Modularity**:
    - Code is organized into different classes based on functionality, making it easier to maintain and extend.

---

### Conclusion
- The WeatherApp demonstrates effective use of OOP principles to create a modular, maintainable, and extensible application.
- It provides a clear separation of concerns, making each component focused on a specific task.
